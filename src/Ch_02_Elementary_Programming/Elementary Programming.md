## Writing a Simple Program

Writing a program involves designing a strategy for solving the problem and then using a programming language to implement that strategy. 

Writing a program involves designing algorithms and translating algorithms into programming instructions, or code. An *algorithm* describes how a problem is solved by listing the actions that need to be taken and the order of their execution. Algorithms can help the programmer plan a program before writing it in a programming language. Algorithms can be described in natural languages or in *pseudocode* (natural language mixed with some program- ming code). The algorithm for calculating the area of a circle can be described as follows:

1. Read the circle's radius
2. Compute the area using the following formula:
2.1.  area = radius x radius * /pi
3. Display the result

When you *code*—that is, when you write a program—you translate an algorithm into a program. You already know that every Java program begins with a `class` definition in which the keyword class is followed by the class name. Assume that you have chosen `ComputeArea` as the class name. The outline of the program would look like this:

<pre><code>
public class ComputeArea {
// Program will be added here
}
</code></pre>
